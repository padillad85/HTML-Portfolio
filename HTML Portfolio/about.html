<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is David. I was born and raised on Chicago ,IL. I lived there until I was 18. Shortly after turning 
  18 I joined the Navy and went to bootcamp in Great Lakes,IL. After attending 12 weeks of training I went to San Antonio
TX. I attended Naval Culinary school at Lackland Air Force base. My career was just beggining there and I was excited to 
see what was next.</p>

<p>While I attended culinary school in San Antonio I was just getting the feel for what not only the Navy was like, but also
  being out on my own and experiencing adult life also. Boy did the military bring together all walks of life and people from
  all over the world. Everyone had different goals. It's here at this Air Force base that I learned what I really wanyted to
  do. Computer's! I was fascinated with computers. Building, repair, software the sounds, everything caught my interest.
</p>

<p>At the end of bootcamp is where I got order's to VAQ 133 Whidbey Island WA. I got to WA at 18 and immediately got to work
  with changing careers. Culinary is fun and all but computers relaxed me. I met with career counselers, Navy admin you name it.
  I gathered everything possible to have an oppurtunity to make it in the IT field. Step 1 was getting my ASVAB score raised.
  I gave all I had to studying and training and went to retake my ASVAB knowing I needed a 50 to change job's. I retook
  my ASVAB and nailed it, a 73!
